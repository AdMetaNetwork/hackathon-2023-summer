## 项目整体简介
### Background

- In the Web3 industry, data is growing at an unprecedented rate. However, this has also brought some urgent and serious problems: the data explosion has brought about the difficulty of extracting effective and valuable information; technical barriers make it difficult for most people to independently Complete data analysis; difficulties in data retrieval/classification; challenges of on-chain/off-chain data integration. These problems hinder the progress of the industry, and we have the responsibility and ability to solve them.
