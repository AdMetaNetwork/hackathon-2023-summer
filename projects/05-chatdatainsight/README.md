## 基本资料

项目名称：ChatData Insight - A tool to analyze blockchain data through chat, using LLM.

项目立项日期 (哪年哪月)：2023.5

## 项目整体简介
### Background

Crypto market capitalization has grown from $17B USD at the start of 2017 to a staggering $2.9T USD in November 2021, indicating a significant surge in the volume of financial data within the ecosystem.

1. The rapid growth of blockchain data complicates analysis and understanding, especially for non-experts using existing platforms.

2. Technical barriers hinder individual data analysis, data retrieval, classification, and on-chain/off-chain integration pose additional challenges.


These issues impede the industry's progress, and we bear both the responsibility and the capacity to address them.


### Project Description
ChatData Insight is a tool to analyze blockchain data through chat, like chatGPT for web3:
1. Seamless user interaction through natural language processing.
2. Highly intelligent data analysis based on generative artificial intelligence.
3. Provide intelligent recommendations based on user preferences and behaviors.
4. Customized dashboards and insight sharing.
